    "text": "The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. \nHer shopping had tired her and her basket ad grown heavier with every step of the way home. \nIn the life her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest;but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. \nShe was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks, She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. \nLooking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. \nIt was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. \nHer first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, \nbut then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, \nso she went to fetch the porter from his basement. \nBy this time her legs were beginning to tremble, \nso she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. \nThen, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for nay intruders who might still be lurking in her flat. \n\nThey went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. \nThe chaos was inconceivable. \nShe had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding;and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. \nAt least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. \nThen a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. \nThe inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. \nThere was no trace of fingerprints, \nbut the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. \nSo their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars 'first job that day and they must have been disturbed. \nThe inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. \nThe old lady though the was a fussy creature, \nbut since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.",

    "text": "People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. \nIndeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. \nThose who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. \nThey leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. \nAs they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, \nand sentiment. \nThings owned for a long time are full associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, \nand so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth. \n\nSome things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. \nAmong these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites. \nCollecting small items can easily become a mania. \nI know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money. \nAs she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote;but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice. \nIt is a harmless bait, \nbut it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction. \n\nCollecting as a serous hobby is quite different and has many advantages. \nIt provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. \nOne does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home. \nWhatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books. \nThis hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, \nbut also in general matters which have some bearing on it. \nThere are also other benefits. \nOne wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find. \nSo one's circle of friends grows. \nSoon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country. \nOver the years, one may well become a authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. \nIn this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to take about it. \nCollecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.",
    "textTranslate": "人们倾向于积累财产，有时甚至没有意识到这样做。 \n事实上，当他们发现一些他们不知道自己拥有的有用的东西时，他们会感到惊喜。 \n那些从不需要搬家的人会不加选择地收集只能被描述为杂乱的东西。 \n他们把不需要的东西放在抽屉、橱柜和阁楼里很多年，因为他们相信有一天他们可能会需要这些东西。 \n随着年龄的增长，人们还会因为另外两个原因积累物品，即缺乏体力和脑力，这两者在丢弃和丢弃时都是必不可少的， \n和感情。 \n长期拥有的东西与过去有着充分的联系，也许与死去的亲戚有关， \n因此，他们逐渐获得了超越其真实价值的价值。 \n\n有些东西是故意在家里收集的，以避免浪费。 \n在这些物品中，我会列出绳子和牛皮纸，它们是节俭的人在打开包裹时保存的，以节省购买这两种必需品的时间。 \n收集小物品很容易成为一种狂热。 \n我认识一个人，她总是从报纸上剪下模特衣服的草图，如果有钱的话，她想买。 \n由于她并不富有，她买得起这些东西的可能性很小；但她从来没有足够的意志力来阻止这种做法。 \n这是一种无害的诱饵， \n但它把她的桌子弄得一团糟，每次她打开它，松散的纸片都会从四面八方掉出来。 \n\n收藏作为一种严肃的爱好是完全不同的，有很多优点。 \n它为闲暇时间提供了放松，因为仅仅看一个人的宝藏总是一种快乐。 \n人们不必外出娱乐，因为收藏品都放在家里。 \n无论它由什么组成，邮票、记录、书籍的第一版——瓷器、玻璃、古董家具、图片、模型车、毛绒鸟、玩具动物——总有一些事情要做，从为最新添加的内容找到合适的位置，到核实参考书中的事实。 \n这个爱好不仅在所选学科上教育一个人， \n但也包括与之有一定关系的一般事项。 \n还有其他好处。 \n人们想结识志同道合的收藏家，获得建议，比较笔记，交换文章，炫耀最新发现。 \n因此，一个人的朋友圈扩大了。 \n很快，这种爱好就会导致旅行，也许是去另一个城镇开会，也许是出国寻找稀有标本，因为收藏家并不局限于任何一个国家。 \n多年来，一个人很可能会成为自己爱好的权威，很可能会被要求在小型聚会上进行非正式演讲，如果成功，还会向更多的观众发表演讲。 \n通过这种方式，自信会增长，首先是掌握一门学科，然后是能够接受它。 \n通过如此建设性地利用业余时间进行收藏，可以让人感到满足，没有时间无聊。",

    "text": "Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. \nWithout it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion;everything would be in state of chaos. \nOnly in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. \nIn ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. \nThe intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. \nHe is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. \nBut people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. \nIt is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, \nso they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. \nIf no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tires, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. \nThey are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. \nThe over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. \nThe guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. \nSome friends of my family had this irritating habit. \nThe only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. \nThen they arrived just when we wanted them. \n\nIf you are citing a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minted too late. \nAlthough being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one;and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. \nAn even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. \nSuch an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone. \n\nShe entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. \nShe gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. \nTo her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. \nShe felt inhere handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down al the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. \nHe agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, \nbut only to take on mail, not passengers. \nThe girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. \nThe porter went to fetch one and arrive back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station;this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail. \nJust as that moment the train came into the station. \nThe girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's van. \nBut the station master was adamant:rules could not be broken and she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind.",
